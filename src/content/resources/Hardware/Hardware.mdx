### Hardware basics
- Microcontrollers (Arduino, STM32), sensors (temperature, pressure, flow)
- Communication buses: I²C, SPI, UART
- Purpose: prototype lab automation, environmental monitoring, instrument interfaces

### Embedded AI
- Small AI models: TinyML, EdgeTPU, Raspberry Pi AI Kit
- Purpose: deploy AI on-device for smart sensing and data collection

### Electronics repair and supply chain
- Skills: BGA soldering, PCB rework, sourcing components, cost structure
- Purpose: understand sustainability — how things are built, reused, or wasted

### Learning resources
- Basic electronics and embedded programming
  - MITx 6.002 Circuits and Electronics
  - Coursera: Embedded Systems

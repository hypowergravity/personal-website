| Tool/Library | Description | How it confirms correctness |
| --- | --- | --- |
| spglib | C library (with Python wrappers) that determines space groups and crystallographic properties from atomic coordinates and cell vectors. | Checks relaxed DFT coordinates against high‑symmetry candidates within a tolerance (e.g., SYMPREC). |
| ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) | Python library that reads VASP, QE, and other outputs; can call spglib automatically. | Lets you quickly compare a final DFT output to the expected structure in a few lines. |
| pymatgen | Materials library built on spglib/ASE principles. | Provides SpacegroupAnalyzer to compute symmetry and transform to ideal high‑symmetry cells for definitive checks. |

## About Me

I’m a curious molecular physicist exploring how molecules move, interact, and transform across space and time. My path has included experimental biophysics and computational work, and I’m learning to connect structure and function in biological systems, including photo‑sensitive proteins.

### Professional Journey

I’m a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Yoshioka lab, ICReDD (Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery), Hokkaido University, where I contribute to research in chemical reaction design and discovery.

My research areas include:

- Macromolecular crystallography and protein dynamics
- Time-resolved crystallographic data analysis and multi-conformational modeling
- Computational modeling of metal organic frameworks
- AI-driven approaches for retrosynthesis and drug discovery
- Protein engineering and fluorescent protein development

### Career Objective

I hope to explore questions at the interface of structure and function, and to learn how to better understand and interpret experimental and computational approaches.

I’m interested in understanding the dance (entropy) of nature, as the underlying principle of chemical potential is conserved across materials.

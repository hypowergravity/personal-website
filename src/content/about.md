## About Me

I am a computational biophysicist with a deep interest in understanding the functional biochemistry of macromolecules through structural biology. My research journey has taken me from experimental biophysics to computational approaches, where I work to understand structure-function relationships of biological systems, particularly photosensitive proteins.

### Professional Journey

Currently, I serve as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Yoshioka lab, ICReDD (Institute for Chemical Reaction Design and Discovery), Hokkaido University, where I contribute to research in chemical reaction design and discovery.

My research areas include:

- Macromolecular crystallography and protein dynamics
- Time-resolved crystallographic data analysis and multi-conformational modeling
- Computational modeling of metal organic frameworks
- AI-driven approaches for retrosynthesis and drug discovery
- Protein engineering and fluorescent protein development

### Career Objective

I hope to contribute to our understanding of molecular mechanisms by learning to better integrate experimental and computational approaches. I am interested in supporting research efforts in chemical reaction design, protein engineering, and exploring how generative AI methodologies might help in retrosynthesis, MOF design, and drug discovery applications.

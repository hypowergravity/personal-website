### About Me
I’m Sriram Srinivasa Raghavan. I’m learning about structure–function relationships in small molecules and proteins, and I try to connect computation with experiment where it helps.

### Background
I’ve worked on macromolecular structure and dynamics, including some photo‑sensitive proteins. I’m still learning how to combine computational modeling and experiments to better understand complex systems.

### Research Interests

#### Areas I'm Working On:
**Crystallographic Data Analysis**
- Learning to develop algorithms for refinement in multi-conformational modeling of time-resolved crystallographic data for macromolecules
- Working on data analysis pipelines for time-resolved crystallography
- Working on indexing algorithms for small molecule crystallography

**Computational Chemistry and AI Applications**
- Exploring how AI and chemoinformatics might assist retrosynthesis and discovery to support chemical and materials research

**Metal Organic Frameworks**
- Exploring crystal structure and property prediction of metal organic frameworks using computational approaches

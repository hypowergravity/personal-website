### About Me

I am Sriram Srinivasa Raghavan, a Researcher interested in structure-function relationships of both small molecules and macromolecules (proteins).

### Professional Background

My previous research focused on macromolecular structure and dynamics, with particular expertise in photo-sensitive proteins. I combine computational modeling with experimental approaches to understand complex molecular systems.

### Research Interests

#### Key Areas of Focus:

**Crystallographic Data Analysis**

- Develop algorithms for refinement for multi-conformational modelling of time resolved crystallographic data for macro-molecules

**Metal Organic Frameworks**

- Study the reaction kinetics of metal organic frameworks using computational and experimental approaches
- Work on indexing algorithms for Time resolved crystallography and Micro electron diffraction

**AI for Chemical Synthesis**

- Work on automating retrosynthesis with artificial intelligence to expedite chemical and material research

### About Me
I am Sriram Srinivasa Raghavan, a researcher with an interest in exploring structure-function relationships of both small molecules and macromolecules (proteins).

### Professional Background
My previous research has focused on macromolecular structure and dynamics, with some experience in photo-sensitive proteins. I enjoy learning how to combine computational modeling with experimental approaches to better understand complex molecular systems.

### Research Interests

#### Areas I'm Working On:
**Crystallographic Data Analysis**
- Learning to develop algorithms for refinement in multi-conformational modeling of time-resolved crystallographic data for macromolecules
- Working on data analysis pipelines for time-resolved crystallography
- Working on indexing algorithms for small molecule crystallography

**Computational Chemistry and AI Applications**
- Exploring how artificial intelligence and chemoinformatics might help automate retrosynthesis and drug discovery to support chemical and material research

**Metal Organic Frameworks**
- Exploring crystal structure and property prediction of metal organic frameworks using computational approaches

### About Me
I am Sriram Srinivasa Raghavan, a researcher with an interest in exploring structure-function relationships of both small molecules and macromolecules (proteins).
### Professional Background
My previous research has focused on macromolecular structure and dynamics, with some experience in photo-sensitive proteins. I enjoy learning how to combine computational modeling with experimental approaches to better understand complex molecular systems.
### Research Interests
#### Areas I'm Working On:
**Crystallographic Data Analysis**
- Learning to develop algorithms for refinement in multi-conformational modeling of time-resolved crystallographic data for macromolecules
**Metal Organic Frameworks**
- Exploring the reaction kinetics of metal organic frameworks using computational and experimental approaches
- Contributing to work on indexing algorithms for time-resolved crystallography and micro electron diffraction
**AI for Chemical Synthesis**
- Interested in learning how artificial intelligence might help automate retrosynthesis to support chemical and material research
